## Conclusions
- High interest rates and lower incomes are strong indicators of loan default.
- Larger loan amounts have a higher likelihood of default.
- Clear distinctions in repayment behavior based on borrower profiles.
- Implementing risk-based pricing and stricter approval criteria for high-risk profiles can reduce credit losses.
